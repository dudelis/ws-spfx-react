# Lab 1 - Setup and CLI

In this lab, you will:
- Create the todo-webpart with the CLI

## Exercise 1 - Creating a Webpart
Create a new React project using the following command:
`yo @microsoft/sharepoint`
`Solution Name: TodoList`
`Framework: React`
`Webpart name: TodoList`

Navigate to the newly created project using the following command:
`cd TodoList`

VS Code will be assumed as the editor of choice for this workshop. Open the project with VS Code. From inside the folder right click and open with VS Code. If you donâ€™t see this option, it means that you forgot to enable VS Code context menu option during installation. You can quickly reinstall VS Code and select that option.
    
Run the application using the following command inside the VS code terminal window
`gulp serve`

Open the workbench and add the webpart to the page.
